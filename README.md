# 2023 Robot

Our robot code for the 2023 FRC season Charged Up

New to this year, we're using:
* Swerve drive (MK4i's)
* Neos (rather than Falcons, which we used last year)
* The new WPILib joystick implementation
* PhotonVision with Apriltags
* Auton pathplanning (with swerve!)
* Fancy rainbow RGB LEDs (the most important part of the robot)
* All the Rev software and hardware
Phew. It's only a few things, rigth? I'm sure we can handle this all before our Week 1 Waco comp... probably.
